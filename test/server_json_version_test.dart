/// hand-maintained version sites always attract.
///
/// Nothing in the package reads this file: it is published by hand with
/// `mcp-publisher publish`, so neither the analyzer nor the release flow can
/// notice when `pubspec.yaml` moves and it does not. The registry rejects a
/// version string it has already seen and never lets one be rewritten, so a
/// stale number here is not a cosmetic problem. It either publishes metadata
/// labelled with the previous release or fails the cut outright.
///
/// The description cap is asserted for the same reason. It is 100 characters
/// in the 2025-12-11 schema, small enough that an ordinary edit overruns it,
/// and the only other place that shows up is a rejected publish.
